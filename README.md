# virtual-wine-sommelier-frontend
Virtual Wine Sommelier is a web service for a Ukrainian wine hypermarket that allows users to explore a curated catalog of wines. Users can search for wines based on parameters such as purpose, price range, mood, and more. They can also add selected wines to their cart, and optionally, create a personal account to manage their purchases.
